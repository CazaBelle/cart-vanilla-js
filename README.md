# Approach 
* As this was intended as an experimental attempt at the challenge there was no testing. I wanted to use this opportunity to explore javascript. 
* The plan had been to repeat the assignment once had felt more comfortable with the logic I would repeat it following strict TDD. This is a quick solution that meets most of the requirements and is fully responsive. 
* Hard coding the values into the html made getting to the logic quicker but is restrictive in terms of expansion. 
* The user can add/remove items from their basket and add discounts.
* The development of this program provided me with valuable experience with javascript and made me reminded me how important testing can be when debugging and refactoring.
* For reasons mentioned above I have repeated the assignment using TDD with Jasmine. 
* An incomplete version using TDD meeting the first few user stories can be seen here [Retail Therapy JS](https://github.com/CazaBelle/retail-therapy-js)
